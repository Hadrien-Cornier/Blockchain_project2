# The Problem

There are over over 2.5 million foriegn domestic workers in the Gulf countries. A majority of these workers arrive to these countries in hopes of improving the lives of their family but end up working primarily in the construction and hospitality industry. However, not everything goes as planned. Check out the following facts:
“Eighty-five per cent of the interviewed migrants signed a contract in Dubai but most of them could not understand its terms as the contract is written in Arabic and some were not sure if they had received a copy.”
“Only 10 per-cent of the interviewed workers reported that their salary was the same as written in the contract, while 37 per cent said it was not.”
There can be very little room for complaining about the dire working conditions. For example, a Saudi employer was accused of chopping off Indian maid’s arm “when she tried to escape the daily harassment, torture and abysmal work conditions”.
“The working hours are frequently more than what the contract states.”
“Only 71 per cent of low-skilled had a weekly day off as provided for by the law.”

What if we recorded the salaries of workers on a Blockchain?
What if the worker and the employer signed a smart contract to automate the payment process? Here is a list of problems it will solve:

There is no chance of deceiving the worker about the terms of the contract since the contract is stored on the ledger on the Blockchain.
The workers will be paid regularly as long as they do their work.
The laborers will also have to show up to work to access their salaries.
The government and nonprofits can access data about whether each worker is paid regularly due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. As a result, the employee cannot threaten the worker about his/her salary and thereby exploit him/her.
Since the information about the salaries of workers and the number of days they worked every month is publicly available, companies will not only have the incentive to provide standard wage, but also comply with holiday regulations.

# How will it work?



# Why it is worth working on it?

Millions of laborers are exploited and they deserve help. That in itself should be the primary motivation of the project. Additionally, automating payrolls also makes the payment system more efficient and transparent.
But why would employers comply with this idea?
Why would exploiters agree to something that would reduce opportunities for exploitation? They most likely wouldn’t. This is why this project requires support from the policy level to enforce this system in companies that are involved in exploitation.
Non-exploiting companies have incentive to comply for obvious reasons: i) It makes their payment system more efficient and laborers are incentivised to come to work; ii) Their regular payment schedule helps attract diligent workers.
